TransiTracker benefits from it relatively simple design. It does not rely on cloud computing
or remote resources aside from Bootstrap, which is used for styling. The entire application 
is run from a single Python/Flask application developed specifically for use by ECU's Transit
department. The application and its database run on a machine located on ECU's campus. Users of 
the TransiTracker application are employees of ECU's Transit department, and must be on ECU's
VPN to access the application. 

While there is no standalone mobile application version of TransiTracker, the application is
fully equiped to handle display and operation on a mobile device.  Modern web browsers make it
exceedingly simple to set style guidelines for screens of different sizes, and we used this to
our greatest advantage.
